# Find My Pie App

## About This Application
This React.js Web Application was bootstrapped with Create React App.
The purpose was to allow the user to enter the name of a fruit they have at home,
and then the external API call from Edaman will load in 10 pie-related recipes
according to the fruit the user typed in!

## About This Application
I learned about importing images and requiring them, reusable components, CSS modules specific to a component,
naming conventions for classes, using State and lifting State as well.

## Project on Heroku
The project is hosted on Heroku via: [this link](https://find-my-pie-app.herokuapp.com/)
